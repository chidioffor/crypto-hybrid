Start Services

# start all services (dev)
npm run dev:services

# or via helper:
./scripts/dev-services.sh

# or Run all (frontend + services) at once
./scripts/dev-all.sh

# or run everything (frontend + services)
npm run dev

# run tests
cd tests && npm test


If you want, I can also add a scripts/dev-all.sh that spins up frontend + services in one command (wrapping npm run dev). ￼
